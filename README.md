# Quiz Game

This is a improved version of my previous simple Quiz Game application. This version can fetch trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database (https://opentdb.com/) and allows users to answer them. Users can select a category and difficulty level before starting the quiz. The game keeps track of the score and displays the results at the end.

## Features

- Fetches trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database API.
- Allows users to select a category and difficulty level.
- Randomizes the order of answer choices.
- Keeps track of the user's score.
- Displays a message based on the user's performance at the end of the quiz.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## How It Was Made

When I first created this project, I determined the questions and categories myself and stored them in the questions.js file. You can find that version of the project in this repository: [Yimikami/dev-quiz-game](https://github.com/Yimikami/dev-quiz-game).

Then, while progressing in the Intermediate JavaScript course on Codédex, I encountered the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) in the [Codédex | 11. Trivia Night](https://www.codedex.io/intermediate-javascript/11-trivia-night) module. I thought I could further improve my project by using this API, so I adapted it to my project.

## What I Learned

I learned advanced concepts of async functions, data fetching, and improved my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Additionally, I learned how to use a function to decode HTML entities (e.g., &quot; to ") (source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/34064434).
